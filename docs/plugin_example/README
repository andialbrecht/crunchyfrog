This is a very basic CrunchyFrog plugin. In fact it
does nothing except showing up in the plugin list on
the preferences page.

It can be used as a template for custom plugins.

To install the plugin run

	python setup.py bdist_egg
	
and copy the generated egg file into the user plugin
directory:

	cp dist/*.egg ~/.cruncyfrog/plugins/
