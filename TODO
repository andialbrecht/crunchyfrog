Database
--------
- Client encoding, e.g. for MySQL cur.execute("SET NAMES utf8;")
- Provide more meta information, incl. detail views.
- Cleanup backend API.
- Track unused connections (not in transaction, not used by an editor) and
  provide a quick way to close them.


User Interface
--------------
- Failed queries: Stop on error with continue/stop dialog.
- Add data source colors. Each data source might have a color that is shown
  in navigator, tab label, statusbar, connection dialog, ...
- Explain view: Enhance explain view with respect to backend specific
  options and return values.
- Replace toolbar from data source manager? It's too large and looks
  ugly with some GTK themes.
- Panes loose state when new instance was created and closed last.
- Replace BottomPane by Pane.
- Save and restore position of pane items.


Editor
------
- Disable export button if no filter plugin is active.
- SQL statement in messages list should point to corresponding row in editor
  when clicking on it.


Library
-------
- Improve save to library function.
- Export/import library.
- Optionally save current connection with statement?


Documentation
-------------
- Some more Plugin examples.


Misc.
-----
- Follow "libgnome must die!" (http://live.gnome.org/LibgnomeMustDie)
- Add support for Capuchin?
  See: http://capuchin.k-d-w.org/
- Remove ReferenceProvider
- Remove LDAP backend?
- Cleanup plugin API
- Add options for CSV export.
  See: http://docs.python.org/lib/csv-fmt-params.html
- Export filter should emit a progress signal (and of course the dialog
  should have a callback).
- LDAP connections make no sense in editor, should be suppressed
  somehow.
- Distribute API docs (crunchyfrog-dev package, devhelp integration).


Windows
-------
- Missing icons.
- SegFaults when resizing panes with missing icons.
- Print preview doesn't work on windows.


Ideas
-----
- Visualize database schema (maybe using gaphas?).
  http://gaphor.devjavu.com/wiki/Subprojects/Gaphas
- Query history, possibly bound to datasource info.
- libgda backend? But maybe it's too confusing to have multiple possibilities
  to connect to a RDBMS.
- Include VTE support.
- Add an template base export plugin (Jinja?). Possible export formats: HTML,
  XML, TeX, plain text, ... The templates could be customizable.
- Visual query builder using sqlalchemy?
- Use PackageKit to install DB-API2 modules?

Software Engineering
--------------------
- Code cleanup... ;-)
