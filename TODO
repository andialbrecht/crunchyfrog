Database
--------
- Client encoding, e.g. for MySQL cur.execute("SET NAMES utf8;")

User Interface
--------------
- Failed queries: Stop on error with continue/stop dialog.
- Explain view: Enhance explain view with respect to backend specific
  options and return values.
- Accelerators don't work in SQL window.
- Replace toolbar from data source manager? It's too large and looks
  ugly with some GTK themes.

Editor
------
- Search (and replace)


Library
-------
- Improve save to library function.
- Improve refresh of library tree when modifying entries.
- Export/import library.
- Optionally save current connection with statement?

Documentation
-------------
- Switch to Sphinx/ReSt, it's easier to maintain.
- Some more Plugin examples.

Misc.
-----
- Follow "libgnome must die!" (http://live.gnome.org/LibgnomeMustDie)
- Add support for Capuchin?
  See: http://capuchin.k-d-w.org/
- Remove ReferenceProvider?
- Add g_set_application_name() when PyGTK 2.13 has landed.
- Add options for CSV export.
  See: http://docs.python.org/lib/csv-fmt-params.html
- Export filter should emit a progress signal (and of course the dialog
  should have a callback).
- LDAP connections make no sense in editor, should be suppressed somehow.


Software Engineering
--------------------
- Code cleanup... ;-)
