Database
--------
- Client encoding, e.g. for MySQL cur.execute("SET NAMES utf8;")


User Interface
--------------
- Failed queries: Stop on error with continue/stop dialog.
- Explain view: Enhance explain view with respect to backend specific
  options and return values.
- Replace toolbar from data source manager? It's too large and looks
  ugly with some GTK themes.
- Panes loose state when new instance was created and closed last.
- Redesign Data Source Manager


Editor
------
- Search (and replace)
- Disable export button if no filter plugin is active.
- Add more information (in a statusbar?): current connection, affected rows...
- SQL statement in messages list should point to corresponding row in editor
  when clicking on them.


Library
-------
- Improve save to library function.
- Export/import library.
- Optionally save current connection with statement?


Documentation
-------------
- Some more Plugin examples.


Misc.
-----
- Follow "libgnome must die!" (http://live.gnome.org/LibgnomeMustDie)
- Add support for Capuchin?
  See: http://capuchin.k-d-w.org/
- Remove ReferenceProvider?
- Add g_set_application_name() when PyGTK 2.13 has landed.
- Add options for CSV export.
  See: http://docs.python.org/lib/csv-fmt-params.html
- Export filter should emit a progress signal (and of course the dialog
  should have a callback).
- LDAP connections make no sense in editor, should be suppressed
  somehow.
- Python shell should check for presence of ipython on startup.
- Include VTE support.
- Print preview doesn't work on windows.


Software Engineering
--------------------
- Code cleanup... ;-)
