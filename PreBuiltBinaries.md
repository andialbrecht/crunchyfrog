This page describes how to install CrunchyFrog on various platforms.




## Ubuntu / Debian ##

To install CrunchyFrog on Ubuntu follow the instructions on
this [PPA page](https://launchpad.net/~crunchyfrog/+archive/ppa)
to add the CrunchyFrog repository to your package manager.

Without being tested, the packages should be installable on Debian too.

If you want to help testing or if you're interested in the latest
features there's a second PPA with
[https://launchpad.net/~crunchyfrog/+archive/crunchyfrog-daily daily
builds (unstable)].

## Arch Linux ##

CrunchyFrog is in AUR:
http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?do_Details&ID=16988

Install it on your system e.g, by using yaourt:

```
yaourt -Ss crunchyfrog
```


## Fedora ##

See this [bug report](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=526451).

## Gentoo ##

I've seen some ebuilds flying around. Maybe it's a good idea to
[search](http://www.google.com/search?q=crunchyfrog+gentoo)
for one of them... ;-)


## Slackware ##

Have a look at
[slacky.eu](http://www.slacky.eu/aadm/pkgs/index.php?pkg=2247&ver=3).


## Windows ##

Currently there's no binary release available for
Windows. InstallingOnWindows has some instructions on how to get this
application running on Windows.

## Mac OS X ##

Refer to InstallingOnMacOs for a preliminary list of required packages
to run CrunchyFrog.
