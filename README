= Getting started =

== Running CrunchyFrog ==

You can run CrunchyFrog from this directory without installing:

	./crunchyfrog

The next thing is to define some datasources by opening the Datasource manager.

See http://code.google.com/p/crunchyfrog/wiki/Requirements for a complete
list of requirements.

== Installing CrunchyFrog ==

For a system-wide installation run:

	make
	make install

To build a Debian/Ubuntu package:

	make deb
	sudo dpkg -i dist/*.deb
	
	NOTE: Building a deb is experimental and should be reviewed by someone
	with some more experiences.


After installing you should find a launcher in your _Applications_ menu.
