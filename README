== Running CrunchyFrog ==

You can run CrunchyFrog from this directory without installing:

	./crunchyfrog

The next thing is to define some datasources by opening the Datasource manager.

See http://code.google.com/p/crunchyfrog/wiki/Requirements for a complete
list of requirements.

== Installing CrunchyFrog ==

For a system-wide installation run:

	make
	make install

Maybe you've already noticed the `debian/` folder... You're right, you can
build a Debian package, but keep in mind that the build routine isn't verified
by someone who knows how to build packages properly and it is only intended
for personal use! Anyway, to build a Debian package:

	make deb
	sudo dpkg -i dist/*.deb


After installing you should find a launcher in your _Applications_ menu.
