CrunchyFrog -- A cross-platform SQL client.
===========================================

CrunchyFrog is a cross-platform SQL client for a variety of database
systems.


Running CrunchyFrog
-------------------

You can run CrunchyFrog from this directory without installing:

    ./crunchyfrog

The next thing is to define some datasources by opening the Datasource manager
(Edit > Data Source Manager).

See requirements.txt for a complete list of requirements.

For a localized version first run

    make msg-compile

and then start the application as described above.
This command requires gettext installed on your system.

To have the manual run

    python setup.py build_manual

and then select "Help > Help" (F1) in the application.
This command requires Sphinx (>=0.5) installed on your system.


Installing CrunchyFrog
----------------------

For a system-wide installation from a source distribution or Subversion
checkout run:

    sudo python setup.py install

After installing you should find a launcher in your Applications menu.

Have a look at the project's homepage to see if a pre-built binary for your
distribution is available.
