== Running CrunchyFrog ==

You can run CrunchyFrog from this directory without installing:

	./crunchyfrog


*Note:* No plugins are activated by default. So first open the preferences
dialog and activate at least one database backend, some export filter and
of course any other plugin you might be interested in.

The next thing is to define some datasources by opening the Datasource manager.


== Installing CrunchyFrog ==

For a system-wide installation run:

	python setup.py install

Maybe you've already noticed the `debian/` folder... You're right, you can
build a Debian package, but keep in mind that the build routine isn't verified
by someone who knows how to build packages properly and it is only intended
for personal use! Anyway, to build a Debian package:

	make deb
	sudo dpkg -i dist/*.deb


After installing you should find a launcher in your _Applications_ menu.
